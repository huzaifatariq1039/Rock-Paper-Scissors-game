# Rock-Paper-Scissors-game
-This is a rock paper scissors game in python

# Code Explanation
-In this game I have used three modules of python language. These modules are sys, random and enum.
-Then I created a class named RPS in which I declared three constants for rock, paper
 and scissors. I have assigned values to them. 
-After that a message is displayed to the user to choose from the given options.
-Then a condition is used to check whether the value entered by the user is greater than
1 and less than 3 or not. If not the program will exit and a message will be displayed 
telling the user that he has entered a wrong value.
-After that i have used the random module which is slecting a random number from 1 to 3.
-In the next step I have used the if else conditions in which all the scenrios of winning 
 and losing of both the computer and the person are mentioned.
